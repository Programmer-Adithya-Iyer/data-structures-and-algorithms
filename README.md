# My LeetCode Repo 🏹

This is basically my **personal playground for LeetCode problems**.  
I’m not storing all the solutions or writing essays here — just the stuff that matters:

- Problem number + name  
- Key insight or “oh wow, didn’t see that coming” moment  
- What actually worked / my approach  
- Optional snippet if it helps me remember  

The point? **Come back later, see what tripped me up, and learn from it without wasting time.**

---

## How I’ve organized this mess

- **Recursion / Backtracking**  
  Stuff that makes me scream “oh god the recursion tree!”  

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
  Classic “subproblems, memoization, cry a little, then succeed” category.  

- **Binary Search / Greedy**  
  When I want to feel smart and just move pointers or pick max/min.  

- **Trees**  
  Binary, N-ary, or anything that makes me go down all the branches.  

- **Graphs**  
  DFS, BFS, topological sort… all the “what even is a node” stuff.  

- **Miscellaneous**  
  Random problems that don’t fit anywhere, but I want to remember.

## How I use this

1. Go to the folder of the category I’m in the mood for.  
2. Open the `README.md` there and scroll through the problem list.  
3. Each problem gets its own `.md` with:
   - Number + name  
   - LeetCode link  
   - Notes / aha moments / what I actually learned  
   - Optional code snippet if it’s tricky to remember  
4. Solve on LeetCode → update the file with insights → feel smart.

## Notes

- This is **my playground**, not a polished tutorial.  
- Problems are stored in **separate `.md` files**, because I like revisiting my own brain damage later.  
- Focus on **insights > code**. I already have the code on LeetCode anyway.  
- Categories will grow as I keep grinding — probably faster than my sleep schedule.
